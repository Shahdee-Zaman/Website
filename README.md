# Website

This is my currently used website hosted at: www.shahdee.dev. Feel free to check it out.

## Background

My previous website was extremely barebones as I had created that one right after learning html and css so I wanted to change it. Everything in this website is built with scalability in mind.

## Features 
- Dynamic Changing background that changes based on User current location and weather.
- Gemini interface that allows recruiters and users to learn more based on the text provided in systeminstructions.txt.
- [Redis based Token limiter](https://github.com/Shahdee-Zaman/Gemini-TPD-Limiter) applied to prevent any unexpected overcharge from Gemini.
- Dockerfile included for quick setup and deployment.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Python(Flask)
- Database: Redis
- Containerization: Docker
- Deployment: AWS EC2
