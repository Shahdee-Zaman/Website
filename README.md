# Website

This is my currently used website hosted at: www.shahdee.dev. Feel free to check it out.

## Background

My previous website was extremely barebones as I had created that one right after learning html and css so I wanted to change it. I will try to keep this website constantly updated but I am currently trying to learn pytorch so no new features will added for a small while.

## Features 

The website has an dynamic changing background that changes depending on the weather of the user's current location. Easy access to all socials at all times.
